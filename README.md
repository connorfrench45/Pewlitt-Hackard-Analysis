# Pewlitt-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this data dive is to organize employee information at Pewlitt Hackard and create two lists: One of potential retirees, and second of potential mentors for the new mentorship program.
## Analysis
#### Retiring Titles
For the first table, the goal was to get the job titles for each potential retiree and count how many potential retirees there were in each job title.

- A vast majority of potential retirees have senior titles (some 50,000 out of 70,000)
- A slight majority are engineers, with the rest mostly generic "staff" titles and almost 4,000 "technique leaders."
With so many potential retirees in senior positions, a good focus would be training up younger employees to be senior staff.
#### Mentorship
To help populate potential mentorships, I made a table with experienced staff. Here's an example of what the table looks like:

- This filter highlights about 1500 potential mentors.
- The potential mentors have desireable titles, given how many senior staff could be retiring.
It would be beneficial to expand the parameters for potential mentors (the filter here was if the employee was born in 1965). With over 70,000 employees potentially retiring, 1500 potential mentors is not enough to help train staff.
## Summary
Most potential retirees are in Senior positions, which follows expectations. However, that means replacements need training. The mentorship program is a good idea to train replacements, though the number of positions needing filled is many times larger than the eligible mentors. Here are my recommendations:
- Expand the mentorship program. Not every eligible mentor will want to participate, so getting closer to 10,000 to 20,000 mentors would more adequately prepare the next generation of leadership
- Focus on preparing employees for senior positions, particularly in engineering, where a vast majority of retirements are likely to happen.
